# Bank-Marketing-Dashboard
The results from the Bank Marketing Dataset helped to reveal patterns in customer behavior and identify which features influenced the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit. Imbalanced target: Most clients do not subscribe. Usually, around 88% 'no' and 12% 'yes' in the target variable y. Students, retirees, unemployed do higher subscriptions.
Single clients tend to subscribe more than married or divorced ones.
Higher education level often correlates with a higher subscription rate.
Cellular contacts lead to better results than telephone. Possibly due to better reach or engagement.
May, June, July, and August usually show higher call volume but lower conversion.
March, September, December may have fewer calls but higher success rates.
Longer calls correlate strongly with a higher chance of success.
Calls under a certain duration (e.g. <100 seconds) almost always result in "no".
